 ## Experiment 11
**Aim:** <br>
To study and implement Classes and Objects <br>
<br>
**Theory:** <br>
_Object Oriented Programming (OOP):_ <br>
Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes. <br>
To understand OOP better, let us understand some key concepts of OOPS <br>
<br>
_Class:_ <br>
A class is a collection of objects, a blueprint of objects defining the common attributes and behavior. This user-defined datatype holds its own instance variables, class variables and member functions which are accessed based on need. This can be done by creating a unique instance of that class.<br>
<br>
_Object:_ <br>
A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. It is an identifiable entity with a set of characteristics and behavior. <br>
<br>
_Inheritance:_ <br>
The mechanism which creates classes that are built upon existing classes, in a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors. <br>
<br>
_Encapsulation:_ <br>
The mechanism which combines similar data and functions into a single unit called a class. It helps protect the data from any change. <br>
<br>
_Abstraction:_ <br>
The mechanism that depends on the separation of the interface and implementation details of the program. It provides only the required details to the user, hiding the technical internal ones. <br>
<br>
_Polymorphism:_ <br>
The mechanism which allows an object to be represented in various forms. <br>

| Procedural Oriented Programming (POP)  |  Object Oriented Programming (OOP) |
|  :-:  |  :-:  |
|   It does not support inheritance. |   It supports inheritance. |
|   It is less secure  |   It is more secure.  |
|   It is a top-down approach.  |   Its is a bottom-up approach. |
|   Program is divided into functions. |   Program is divided into objects.  |
|   Data can move freely from function to another function within programs. |   Object can move freely within member functions. |
|   It does not use access modifiers.  |   Makes use of access modifiers like _public_, _private_ and _protected_.  |

<br>

_Advantages of Object Oriented Programming:_
1. Reusability <br>
2. Data Redundancy <br>
3. Code Maintainance <br>
4. Flexibility <br>
5. Security <br>
<br>
This is why C++ is preffered over C as OOP is very advantageous. <br>
